They ranked 4th in offensive production and played at the 3rd fastest pace in the league. Their system was built around Ja Morant’s explosive drives, grabbing offensive rebounds to create second-chance opportunities, and a strong transition game.

With Morant missing significant time, Memphis leaned more on a defensive identity anchored by Jaren Jackson Jr. This shift is reflected in the improved defensive ranking (3rd best) even if the raw number (110.7) might look less impressive compared to the previous season’s 108.9. (Keep in mind that rankings can shift based on league-wide efficiency changes and relative performance.) In effect, the team became more balanced, leaning on a stout defense to mask the slight dip in offensive net production. |            |\n",
